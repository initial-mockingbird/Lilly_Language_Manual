# The Lilly Language

## Foreword

The current document is inteded as a reference manual for the Lilly language.
It lists the language constructs, gives their precise syntax, and describes
their informal semantics. The document does not constitute a tutorial to
the language.

## Notations

The syntax of the language is described using a BNF-like notation. Terminal
symbols are written in type-writer font \\(\texttt{such  this} \\).
Non-terminal symbols are written in italics *such as this*. Square brackets
\\([...] \\) indicate optional parts of the syntax. Curly braces \\( \\{ \\} \\) indicate
zero or more repetitions of the enclosed syntax. Curly braces with a
trailing plus sign \\( \\{ \\}^+ \\) indicate one or more repetitions of the
enclosed syntax. Finally, parenthesis \\( \(...\) \\) denote grouping.
