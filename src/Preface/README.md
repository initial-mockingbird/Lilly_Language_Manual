# Preface

Spreadsheets are the most widely used computing environment in the world.
They are also notoriously regarded as error prone, hard to maintain,
and generalize. We believe the potential of the spreadsheet computing paradigm
has not been explored properly. The ZenSheet project
revisits spreadsheets from a programming language design
perspective with the purpose of alleviating their issues and
limitations.

## Objectives

The primary goal of ZenSheet is to provide a programming environment
that is as easy to use as a spreadsheet, but with the power of a programming language.

In order to avoid common pitfalls regarding abstraction, such an environment
must be a function of the model, thus, the language that runs underneath
must be easily extendible to accomodate this.

Finally, it must not sacrifice its simplicity persuing generality. Every
feature must have a clear purpose, be easy to use, and be based on solid
foundations.
